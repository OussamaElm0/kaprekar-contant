<h1>About this project</h1>
This Python program implements Kaprekar's routine for the constant 6174. It takes a user-input four-digit number, applies a series of operations involving sorting digits in ascending and descending order, and iteratively performs these steps until reaching the fixed point 6174. The program then outputs the number of iterations required to achieve this constant. Kaprekar's routine is a mathematical curiosity known for its self-reducing properties when applied to four-digit numbers.
